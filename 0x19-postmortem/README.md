##Post-Mortem Report: Web Stack Outage

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: April 7, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC-5)
End Time: April 7, 2024, 2:45 PM (UTC-5)

Impact:
The outage affected the availability of our web application, causing a complete service disruption for approximately 30% of our users. Users experienced slow page loading times and intermittent errors when trying to access the platform.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven distribution of traffic among the application servers.

Timeline:

10:30 AM:
The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server response times.

10:35 AM:
The engineering team was alerted to the issue and began investigating.

10:50 AM:
Initial investigations focused on the application servers and database clusters, as they were suspected to be the source of the slowdown.

11:15 AM:
Debugging efforts were misdirected towards network issues, leading to temporary confusion and delays in identifying the root cause.

11:45 AM:
After further analysis, it was determined that the load balancer was not evenly distributing traffic, causing overloading on certain servers.

12:00 PM:
The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for immediate resolution.

1:30 PM:
The misconfigured load balancer settings were identified and corrected, restoring normal traffic distribution.

2:45 PM:
Verification checks confirmed that the issue had been resolved, and services were fully restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause Explanation:
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings resulted in uneven distribution of traffic, leading to server overload and degraded performance.

Resolution:
The issue was fixed by adjusting the load balancer configuration to evenly distribute incoming requests among the application servers.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Implement automated checks for load balancer configurations to detect misconfigurations in real-time.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to proactively identify performance issues and prevent similar outages.
Conduct regular audits of infrastructure configurations to ensure consistency and reliability.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Implement automated load balancer configuration checks by end of week (April 12, 2024).
Enhance monitoring system to include performance thresholds and alerts by next sprint (April 20, 2024).
Schedule quarterly infrastructure audits in the late months of 2024
